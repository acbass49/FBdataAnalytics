personal analysis and shiny app for others

I am working on building the shiny app that allows for users to input their data and see personalized graphs of:
1. Facebook Usage Over Time
2. Favorite Emojis
3. My Guess Of Your Best Facebook Friends
4. Simple Sentiment Analysis Of All Posts And Comments

json.R is the script I used to turn a json file into these 4 figures.

I write up and display these figures on my blog here: https://alexbass.me/post/facebook-exposed/
